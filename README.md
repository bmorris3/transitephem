transitephem
============

A Pythonic transiting exoplanet ephemeris generator. Requirements include Numpy, PyEphem, and astropy. These scripts are largely lifted from [OSCAAR](http://oscaar.github.io/OSCAAR/), and make use of exoplanet data from [exoplanets.org](http://exoplanets.org/). 

The transit time predictions are likely accurate to within an hour -- those transit events with the oldest references likely have the most inaccurate transit time predictions.
